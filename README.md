This is a script I just encountered on an Instagram page just wanted to try it out and see if it is real I just wasn't sure about the math part I wrote it down and voila wath a simple and beautiful code it is.
I'm not sure about the COPYRIGHt issues regarding using and posting it on my github so please inform me on the comments if there is anything morally and legally wrong about my repository. And here bellow I mention the real owner of the post:

the above link is the link pointing to the post I saw on instagram and want to say that the publisher of the code is @pythonnotes1 on instagram don't actually believe that the mentioned page is the owner of the code
as pages like this are actually pages that doesn't work morally and copy paste codes of others but here is where I saw the codes and I give all the credits to this Instagram page.
